Given a string containing the current state of the control crystals inner pathways (labeled as "X")
and its gaps (labeled as "."), generate the shortest path from the start node (labeled as "S")
to the goal node (labeled as "G") and return the new pathway (labeled with "P" characters).
If no solution is possible, return the string "Oh for crying out loud..." (in frustration).

    Nodes labeled as "X" are not traversable.
    Nodes labeled as "." are traversable.
    A pathway can be grown in eight directions (up, down, left, right, up-left, up-right, down-left, down-right),
        so diagonals are possible.
    Nodes labeled "S" and "G" are not to be replaced with "P" in the case of a solution.
    The shortest path is defined as the path with the shortest euclidean distance going from one node to the next.
    If several paths are possible with the same shortest distance, return any one of them.
Note that the mazes won't always be squares.

.S...             .SP..
XXX..             XXXP.
.X.XX      =>     .XPXX
..X..             .PX..
G...X             G...X

S....
XX...
...XX      =>     "Oh for crying out loud..."
.XXX.
XX..G

Note: Your solution will have to be efficient because it will have to deal with a lot of maps and big ones.
